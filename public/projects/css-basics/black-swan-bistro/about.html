            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                Black Swan Bistro opened its doors in 2010 with a simple mission: to bring 
                exceptional dining experiences to the heart of Perth. What started as a small, 
                intimate restaurant has grown into one of the city's most beloved dining destinations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, we've remained committed to our founding principles: sourcing the 
                finest local ingredients, supporting Western Australian producers, and creating 
                dishes that celebrate the diversity and quality of Australian cuisine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our location along the Swan River provides the perfect setting for memorable meals, 
                whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply enjoying good food with 
                good company.

                <p>
                    With over 20 years of culinary experience spanning three continents, Chef Maria 
                    Rodriguez brings a wealth of expertise and passion to Black Swan Bistro. After 
                    training in Spain and working in Michelin-starred restaurants in France, Maria 
                    fell in love with Australian cuisine during a visit to Perth in 2008.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What drew me to Australia was the incredible quality and variety of local 
                    produce," Maria explains. "From the fresh seafood to the unique native 
                    ingredients, there's an endless opportunity for creativity in the kitchen."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since joining Black Swan Bistro in 2015, Maria has transformed our menu into 
                    a celebration of modern Australian cuisine, incorporating native ingredients 
                    like wattleseed, finger lime, and native pepperberry into contemporary dishes.
                </p>
