				<h2 class="title is-3">Meet Helen Burgess</h2>

				<p class="feature-text">
					<i class="fas fa-hand-wave"></i>Hi! I'm Helen, and I've spent over two decades watching the web evolve from simple HTML pages to the dynamic platforms we build today.
				</p>

				<p class="is-size-5">
					My journey started in the early 2000s, hand-coding websites when CSS was just becoming a thing. Since then, I've worn many hats—developer, educator, mentor, and life-long learner. Through it all, I've noticed a pattern: talented people struggling not because coding is hard, but because traditional tutorials miss the forest for the trees.
				</p>

				<p class="feature-text">
					<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> You see, knowing syntax is one thing. But understanding how to actually build and launch real websites? That's where most learning resources fall short.
				</p>

				<p class="is-size-5">
				That's why I created GraphitEdge—to share not just code, but the complete picture of web development. Using visual explanations, real-world examples, and plain language, we bridge the gap between "I can code" and "I can build professional websites."

					Our Core Values
				</h2>
				<p class="feature-text">
					<i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Everything we do at GraphitEdge is guided by five fundamental principles:
				</p>	
				<ul class="checkmark-list">
					<li>Clarity Over Complexity - We break things down step-by-step and explain the why, not just the how. If it's confusing, we rewrite it—because learning should feel like a lightbulb moment, not a wall of text</li>
					<li>Learning with Purpose - Our content is designed to help you build real skills you can apply. Whether you want to launch a project, change careers, or simply understand the internet better—you're in the right place.</li>
					<li>Beginner-Friendly Always - You don't need a computer science degree to start here. We welcome the curious, the self-taught, the career switchers, and everyone in between.</li>
					<li>Inclusive & Personal - GraphitEdge is grounded in lived experience. We're here to support a wide range of learners—across age, background, and ability—and to create a safe space where everyone feels like they belong.</li>
					<li>Creative Exploration Through Code - Coding is a craft, and creativity fuels great development. From layout design to logic flows, we encourage exploration, experimentation, and finding your own voice on the web.</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
		<div class="our-approach mb-6">
				<h2 class="title is-3">Our Approach: Learn by Building a Real-World Project</h2>
				<p>At GraphitEdge, we believe in learning by doing—not just watching. That's why we've created "Rotto Rocks", an immersive project inspired by the stunning beauty of Rottnest Island and the charm of the Black Swan Bistro, a fictional Western Australian restaurant.</p>
				<p>
					As you build this real-world project step by step, you'll master not just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but the entire web development ecosystem. You'll learn:</p>
				<ul class="checkmark-list">
					<li>How the internet works (domains, DNS, hosting, and deployment)</li>
					<li>How to take a design and turn it into a functional website</li>
					<li>The science behind effective web pages (SEO, CTAs, performance optimization)</li>
					<li>How to build interactive, modern web experiences using Vue.js & Bulma</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="is-size-5">
					No more disconnected tutorials—GraphitEdge gives you the missing pieces of web development in a structured, practical learning experience.
